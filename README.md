# React Password Generator

A sleek and dynamic password generator built with React. This project demonstrates the practical use of core React Hooks to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly password generation tool.

## Features

- Generate secure, random passwords instantly

- Adjustable password length

- Numbers

- Special characters

- One-click copy to clipboard

- Clean and responsive UI

 ## Built With

- React

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- Tailwind CSS 

## What I Learned

In this project, I explored and implemented key React Hooks:

- useState – For managing password length and options

- useEffect – For handling side effects and dynamic updates

- useCallback – For optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders

- useRef – For direct DOM access (e.g., copying password to clipboard)

This project strengthened my understanding of state management, component re-rendering, and performance optimization in React.

 ## Future Improvements

- Add password strength indicator

- Add dark/light theme toggle

- Add history of generated passwords

## Project Purpose

This project was built to deepen my understanding of React Hooks and improve my front-end development skills by building a practical and real-world utility application.
